# Procedural City / City Block Generator 

This is a relatively simple procedural city / city block generator built using the latest version of THREE.js (r102).

It uses a speed-optimized perlin noise generator in order to allocate city blocks. I've tried to include as much detail and info in the javascript code comments (js/procedural.city.generator.js). Full credit for the perlin noise implementation goes to Stefan Gustavson (stegu@itn.liu.se), Peter Eastman, and Joseph Gentle.
